Publicly available dataset and code for:

N. Ranc, P.R. Moorcroft, F. Ossi & F. Cagnacci. 2021. Memory drives foraging decisions in a large wild mammal: evidence from a field experiment. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. https://doi.org/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX


## Dataset
The dataset is composed of two files:
1. Ranc_et_al_2021_PNAS_data_population_ts.csv
1. Ranc_et_al_2021_PNAS_data_population_tslv.csv

### Ranc_et_al_2021_PNAS_data_population_ts.csv
This file stores the hourly state time-series for each animal-year as well as corresponding covariates. The files include the following columns:
* exp_id: animal-year identifier (short code for experimental id)
* current_state_code: resource state currently utilized; 1 = manipulated feeding site (M); 2 = alternative feeding site (A); 3 = vegetation (V)
* res_access_m: accessibility of resources at the manipulated feeding site (M); 1 during pre-closure and post-closure; 0 during closure
* light_i: light intensity (standardized)
* light_r: light rate of change (standardized)
* light_abs_r: light absolute rate of change (standardized)
* min_temp: minimum daily temperature (standardized)
